Next release
------------

- Fix tests under 1.2a4+.

- Depend explicitly on zope.configuration.

- Use our a local PyramidConfigurationMachine when collecting ZCML actions,
  and splice the locally collected actions onto the configurator context's
  actions when ZCML processing is done.  This provides Pyramid the freedom to
  not rely on zope.configuration in the future, and somewhat futureproofs
  ``pyramid_zcml`` from changes to action processing in Pyramid.

----------------

- Compatible with Pyramid 1.2a1.

0.4 (2011-08-17)

- Compatible with Pyramid 1.2dev+.

0.3 (2011-07-22)
----------------

- Add tox.ini for testing.

- Pyramid 1.1 test suite fixes.

0.2 (2011-02-22)
-----------------

- Add ``wild_domain`` argument to authtkauthpolicy directive.

- Depend on ``pyramid>=1.0b1`` (``wild_domain`` argument to authtktauthpolicy
  directive).

- Make tests pass on Pyramid 1.0; squash testing deprecation warnings.

0.1 (unknown)
-------------

- Initial release, all ZCML directives broken out of Pyramid core.
